                            <p>Parasyte (寄生獣) is recommended for those who want to watch an eccentric or bizarre anime. It is famous for the original renowned manga published from 1988 to 1995 and its anime adaption, known as Parasyte -the maxim- (寄生獣 セイの格率),which was aired with 24 episodes in 2014-2015.
                                In the sci-fi thriller anime, worm-like creatures Parasites come to the earth and parasitize human brains. The people parasitized by the creatures go berserk and have the power to kill others. The protagonist Shinichi Izumi, who is a 17-year-old high school student, is attacked by a Parasite but prevents it
                             from living in his head. Instead, the parasite invades his right hand. The anime represents how emotional human beings are by contrast to how rational parasites are.
